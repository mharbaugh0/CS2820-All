# CS2820 Spring 2024 WARP Project Code **updated** 
This code base will be used for the University of Iowa CS 2820 Introduction to Software
Development course. The code was developed by Steve Goddard for the WARP sensor network 
research project. It was first written in Swift and rewritten in Java. It was then 
rewritten again in an object-oriented programming style. It was a quick
hack, and it needs a lot of cleanup and refactoring. A perfect code base to teach
the value of software development fundamentals!

<b> Sprint 1 distribution: </b>

- Dell: Step 1
- Weipeng: Step 2
- Matt and Esteban: Step 3

Diagrams and design documents for Sprint 1: 
- UML Sequence Diagram showing program flow starting with Warp processing the ‘ca’ option, created using sequencediagram.org, located in the 'architecture' folder
- Project plan documents (located in README, 'doc' folder, and updated UML source files) outlining team roles, approximate timeline of sprints, tasks completed, tasks yet to be completed, and deliverables expected at each step. 

<b> Sprint 2 distribution: </b>

- Weipeng: Step 5
- Matt: Step 3
- Dell: Step 2&3
- Esteban: Step 4
- All: Step 1&6

<b> Sprint 3 distribution: </b>

- Esteban: Step 2
- Xander and Dell: Step 3
- Matt: Step 4
- Weipeng: Step 5

In Sprint 1,
 
Dell will be the maintainer for the project and the Scrum Master. The team will maintain a Google Doc to track tasks and assignments. Communication will be through Discord. Weipang will work on the sequence diagram, while Dell will handle the ReadMe file and task assignments. Matt and Esteban will review project plans and other files. They have also created a UML class diagram for Warp.java.

Sprint 2 

will see everyone managing the ReadMe file and design docs. Dell will update the existing UML file for Warp. Dell and Matt will ensure code compliance with the Google style guide, with the team assisting as needed. Weipeng will manage JUnit tests and ensure code functionality. Esteban will handle JavaDoc comments and update the UML diagram. Progress will be reviewed as a group.

Sprint 3

will likely follow a similar process. The code will include new helper methods, and the team will collaborate to reduce the workload. Weipeng and Dell will lead the JUnit tests, Matt will create JavaDoc comments for new methods, and Esteban will update the UML file. The team will update the ReadMe file to reflect their work.
